## Tips for Large Datasets

### 1. Data Preparation
- Use consistent date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Use proper text encoding (UTF-8)
- Avoid special characters in column headers

### 2. File Size Considerations
- Excel files should be under 10MB for optimal performance
- For very large datasets, consider splitting into multiple files
- CSV files are generally smaller and faster to process

### 3. Error Handling
- The system will show validation errors with row numbers
- Fix errors in your Excel file and re-upload
- Only valid rows will be uploaded to the database

### 4. Backup
- Always keep a backup of your original Excel files
- The system creates a copy in the database, but it's good practice to maintain source files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid file type" error**
   - Ensure you're uploading .xlsx, .xls, or .csv files
   - Check that the file isn't corrupted

2. **"Validation errors found"**
   - Check the error list for specific row numbers
   - Ensure all required fields are filled
   - Verify date formats are correct

3. **"Upload failed" error**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure you're logged in as an admin
   - Try uploading a smaller file first

4. **"Processing..." takes too long**
   - Large files may take time to process
   - Consider splitting large files into smaller chunks
   - Check your browser's console for any errors

### Performance Tips

- For datasets with 100+ records, consider uploading in batches
- Use CSV format for faster processing
- Ensure your Excel file doesn't have unnecessary formatting
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory

## Security Notes

- Only administrators can access this feature
- Files are processed client-side for validation
- No files are stored on the server permanently
- All data is validated before database insertion
